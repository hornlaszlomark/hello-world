# hello-world
Starting out with github

Hello World,
I'm looking forward to share my ideas and projects with everyone. 
I mainly use Python and databases (SQL). I've done things like scraping, data wrangling, data visualization and automation.
Right now I'm interested in smaller projects considering algotrading, portfolio management and Android application development.

Also, I love meteorology! I'd like to research correlations and causations between weather and small businesses. Decide how these small businesses could gain advantage using weather forecasts or alternative data.

Cheers,

HLM
